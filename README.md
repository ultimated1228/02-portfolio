<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was the seccond assignment within the UC-I full stack coding bootcamp class of Nov 2023.
I was inspired by Lauren Wallers site here: https://www.lauren-waller.com/ 

Too keep it on a single page I used 100% VH for the main content and then allowed users to click down to the content below the screen. I added transform elements to the links, and pop-ups to give users more information about various elements. 

I tried to keep the overall design simple which is what I liked the most about Lauren's site.  I played with elements quite a bit to get them to do what I wanted, so there is certainly some redudancy in the code as a result.
